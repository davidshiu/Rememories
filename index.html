<p>Growing up I loved to solve problems, whether it was simple math equations or fixing things that were broken in my house. As I entered high school I saw myself drift towards engineering. Engineering to me was fun and challenging. There were many different directions I couldv'e taken with engineering, but Computer Science is the path I am taking and it is now my passion. Coding has become something I love to learn more of, whether it's learning new languages or just becoming a more efficient programmer.</p>

    <p><ul><li><b>NCR Corporation: </b>I went through the life cycle of NCR's Point-Of-Sales System, ALOHA. I worked with their Network Securtiy Service to update firewall policies at remote ALOHA sites and I configured firewalls. I shadowed their tech support and learned good customer service manners and about NCR's ticketing system. One project I had was creating a new skin for the ALOHA layout to make it more appealing and efficient using their Aloha Manager program. The final project I had was creating a user guide on how to execute several commands using ALOHA.</li><li><b>Indigitous #Hack 2016: </b>My team attempted to create a game based off of Google's "No Internet Connection" game. We were able to replace the sprites in the game with our own.</li></ul></p>
